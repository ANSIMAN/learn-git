Push our git to remote git:

	$git remote add origin git@github.com:yourAcountName/learngit.git
	$git push -u origin master

From now on if you commit on you computer you can push it to github(push newest changes)
	$git push origin master
	
Clone a git from gitskill.git

	$git clone git@github.com:yourname/gitskill.git

then you can see the git things by

	$cd gitskill
	$ls
create a branch name after dev
	$git checkout -b dev

is equal to 
	$git branch dev
        $git checkout dev
use git branch to check all the branch

switch to master

	$git checkout master

merge the dev branch

	$git merge dev

delete the dev branch
	$git branch -d dev

Sometimes if you can not merge branch you should fix the comflict and add it commit it then try to merge it again

if you want to see merge picture
	$git log --graph
